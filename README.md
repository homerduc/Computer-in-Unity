# Computer in Unity
My goal is to create a highly simplified computer environment in Unity to be able to create games that take place on a computer, and be as free to create anything I want as possible.
As I am currently developing it, this repo and this README are not yet made for guiding people to use the project. My goal is to make it public and usable in the future if I am still involved in it.

I'm trying to make my object oriented design as clean and extensible as possible, but I know it isn't. I need to practice programming in C# to both get better with the language, and to retreive all of my good OOP practices habits. If by any chance any C# or object oriented designer and/or programmer stumbles apon this project, I would really appreciate any advice on what I do wrong and on how I could improve and strengthen my program.
